      <description>This is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been putting off writing for a while now, but it had to happen. The Bitcoin community gave me so much over the years, and I hope this will serve as a small nudge to making it as incredible as it used to. For years I was &amp;ldquo;the bitcoin person&amp;rdquo; in pretty much any group I was in. Bitcoin, not crypto. And for the past few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve slowly distanced myself from that label.</description>
